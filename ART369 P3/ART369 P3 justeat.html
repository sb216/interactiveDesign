					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> <span class = "lowercase"> Canada, 75 minutes </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> Filmmakers and food lovers Jen and Grant dive into the issue of food waste from farm, through retail, all the way to the back of their own fridge. After catching a glimpse of the billions of dollars of good food that is tossed each year in North America, they pledge to quit grocery shopping cold turkey and survive only on foods that has been discarded. In a nation where one in ten people is food insecure, the images they capture of squandered groceries are both shocking and strangely compelling. But as Grant’s addictive personality turns full tilt towards food rescue, the ‘thrill of the find’ has unexpected consequences. Featuring interviews with author, activist and TED lecturer TristramStuart, food waste expert Dana Gunders, and acclaimed author Jonathan Bloom, Just Eat It looks at our systemic obsession with expiry dates, perfect produce and portion sizes, and reveals the core of this seemingly insignificant issue that is having devastating consequences around the globe. Just Eat It brings farmers, retailers, inspiring organizations, and consumers to the table in a cinematic story that is equal parts education and delicious entertainment. </p>

					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> <span class = "lowercase"> USA & Mexico, 8 minutes </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> Winners of the Sundance Institute Short Film Challenge, Phil and Jesse originally created this film as an illustration of the emergence story by the Papago Indians of Southern Arizona. Man in the Maze takes us on a journey through the US borderlands, where we see how people are coming up with innovative solutions to mend our broken food system. The right choices lead us to a point of harmony with all things, no matter how hard or long the road taken. Food activist, writer, and conservationist Gary Paul Nabhan sits at the intersection of inspired food activists, farmers, and change-makers. Here in Southern Arizona where it seems like there is no hope, there is a grassroots food movement shifting the way we grow and eat our food.</p>
