					<p class = "subtitle"> Shorts Program </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> Santa Cruz del Islote, <span class = "lowercase"> directed by Luke Lorentzen </span> </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> USA, <span class = "lowercase"> 19 minutes </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> Santa Cruz del Islote is a three-acre island about fifty miles off the coast of Cartagena, Colombia. It is a community of about 600 people making it one of the most densely populated islands in the world. This region’s lucrative fishing, which encouraged such overdevelopment, has dwindled in recent years, and the island’s subsistence has become increasingly uncertain. In following a fisherman and a ten-year-old boy, this short documentary captures the complexity of cherishing a peaceful way of life that can no longer continue with ease. </p>

					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> Mother Kuskokwim, <span class = "lowercase"> directed by Tim Guthrie </span> </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> USA, <span class = "lowercase"> 23 minutes </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> Mother Kuskokwim profiles the Kuskokwim River Delta in Southwestern Alaska and the native Yup’ik people who live there. This region suffers from some of the worst rural poverty in the United States. This poverty is made worse by isolation, extreme temperatures in the winter, and the enormous cost of goods and services. Many live without electricity or running water. However, despite these challenges, the Yup’ik maintain a deep spiritual connection to their land where they continue to practice an ancient subsistence lifestyle that includes hunting, fishing, and gathering wild berries and plants. All of this takes place in the context of a wild and largely intact tundra wilderness, which is currently threatened by climate change. </p>

					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> Soil Carbon Cowboys, <span class = "lowercase"> directed by Peter Byck </span> </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> USA, <span class = "lowercase"> 12 minutes </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> Soil Carbon Cowboys celebrates renegade ranchers and scientists who are knocking long-held assumptions on their tails. It is a widely held assumption that cows are horrible for the environment because they damage soils, pollute waterways and are a major source of greenhouse gases. It is also conventional wisdom that it takes one thousand years to build an inch of topsoil. Under current cattle industry practices and mainstream scientific frameworks, both assumptions prove true. But the maverick ranchers we’ve found for Soil Carbon Cowboys have a new method of ranching that regenerates the soil, cleans the water, produces healthier crops and beef and may well slow climate change itself. </p>

					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> What's Motivating Hayes?, <span class = "lowercase"> directed by Jonathan Demme </span> </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> USA, <span class = "lowercase"> 14 minutes </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> A documentary by Academy Award-winning director Jonathan Demme (The Silence of the Lambs) about biologist Tyrone Hayes, inspired by a Rachel Aviv article that appeared in The New Yorker magazine. When the agri-business Syngenta hired Tyrone Hayes to test the effects of a new pesticide called Atrazine on frogs, Hayes discovered shocking results. The findings led Syngenta to enact a plan to discredit Hayes, asking the basic question, “What’s Motivating Hayes?”</p>

					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> A Siege of Salt and Sand, <span class = "lowercase"> directed by Sam McNeil </span> </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> USA, <span class = "lowercase"> 43 minutes </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> Tunisia is beset by climate change: sea-level rise, desertification, water scarcity, and species loss. With two backpacks of DLSR gear, Samuel McNeil and Radhouane Addala traveled across Tunisia to visualize the fallout of climate change today in North Africa. Caught between the corrupting sea and the hungry desert, Tunisia now faces a catastrophic convergence of climate chaos just as the Jasmine Revolution continues to transform the Mediterranean and Saharan country. From ‘The Shore of Death’ in Gabes to the desert-plague of the south, the invasive sea to clear-cut hillocks, Rad and Sam hope to share the stories of scientists, farmers, fishermen, doctors, officials and activists on the front lines of climate change.</p>

					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> Prescription Strength, <span class = "lowercase"> directed by Justin Bogardus </span> </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> USA, <span class = "lowercase"> ~1 minute each</span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> One lost man, longing for the apocalypse, neutered and crippled by modern life, finds an answer…a hilarious and obvious truth he was missing (and as he discovers – many of us were missing) all along. In the process he sees how absurdly disconnected he was from himself, his loved ones, and the world around him. Finally having fun, feeling sexy with his wife, wild, peaceful and free, this man is blunt in his prescription for what ails our modern society and even more clear about what is the cure for us all…. </p>
