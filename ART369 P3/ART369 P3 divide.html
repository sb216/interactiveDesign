					<p id = "main-text"> Jean Hill, a fiery octogenarian, cares deeply about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Adriana Cohen: mother, model and celebrity publicist-turned-pundit, unequivocally defends individual freedoms. When Jean tries to ban single-serve plastic bottled water in Concord, Massachusetts, Adriana is supported by local merchants, the International Bottled Water Association and national news outlets in opposition. In a town that incited the American Revolution and inspired Thoreau’s environmental movement, can one senior citizen make history? A tense, nail-biter of a vote will decide. </p>

					<p id = "main-text"> Willits, CA, an eclectic town two hours north of San Francisco, faces an uncertain future during California’s worst drought in 500 years. With just a 100-day supply of water left, cooperation, conservation, and finger pointing all compete in a community made up of ranchers, back-to-the-landers, and marijuana growers. </p>
