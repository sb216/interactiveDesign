What kind of effect has it had, and is that consistent with what CI had hoped?  Is nature helped by giving it a voice?  And what was it like to work with some of Hollywood’s brightest stars?   Join Will Villota, Conservation International’s Vice President of Brand Marketing, for a screening, presentation, and critical discussion of their viral sensation Nature Is Speaking campaign.</p>

					<p class = "subtitle event-title"> Special Exhibition Screening </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> <span class = "lowercase"> Thursday, 4/2 at 7pm <br> Kroon Hall </span> </p>
					<br> 
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> Pad Yatra, <span class = "lowercase"> directed Wendy Lee in Partnership with Yale Himalaya Initiative</span> </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> <span class = "lowercase"> USA, India & Nepal, 70 minutes </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> Pad Yatra: A Green Odyssey is the adventure of 700 people trekking across the Himalayas with a call to save the planet’s “3rd Pole,” a glacial region now devastated by the climate chaos associated with global warming. Battling the most treacherous terrain on the planet, the trekkers spread their message of ecological compassion through human’s most basic means – by walking on foot, village to village, and showing by example. Surviving harrowing injuries, illness, and starvation, they emerge with nearly half a ton of plastic litter strapped to their backs, triggering an historic green revolution across the rooftop of the world.</p>

					<p class = "subtitle event-title"> Youth Programming Day </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> <span class = "lowercase">Thursday, 4/9 </span> </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> The Dam Keeper, <span class = "lowercase"> Directed   by   Robert   Kondo  and  Dice Tsutsumi </span> </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> <span class = "lowercase"> USA, 18 minutes </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> EFFY is pleased – no, overjoyed – to bring one of the most beloved films of its 2014 festival back to EFFY 2015. The Dam Keeper, which was nominated for a 2015 Academy Award (Best Animated Short Film), will be shown to some of New Haven’s school children before they visit some other treats on Yale’s campus.  Teachers or school administrators who would like to inquire about joining this screening should write to Dawn Henning, EFFY’s Associate Director of Youth Programming (dawn.henning@yale.edu). </p>
					<br> 
					<p class = "main-text"> The Dam Keeper, an original animated short film by feature animation artists Robert Kondo and Dice Tsutsumi, tells the tale of a young pig encumbered with an important job, and the meeting of a new classmate who changes everything.  Set in a desolate future, one small town’s survival is solely due to a large windmill dam that acts as a fan to keep out poisonous clouds. Despite bullying from classmates and an indifferent public, the dam’s operator, Pig, works tirelessly to keep the sails spinning in order to protect the town. When a new student, Fox, joins Pig’s class, everything begins to change.  Made up of over 8,000 paintings, The Dam Keeper blends traditional hand-drawn animation with lush brushstrokes to bring Kondo and Tsutsumi’s celebrated painting-style to life like never before. The Danish actor Lars Mikkelsen of television’s Forbrydelsen (The Killing), and BBC’s Sherlock, narrates this timeless fable. Directors Robert Kondo and Dice Tsutsumi are known for their art direction on such beloved films as Ice Age, Ratatouille, Monsters University and Toy Story 3.</p>
