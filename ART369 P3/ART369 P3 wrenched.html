					<p id = "main-text">Filmmaker ML Lincoln’s documentary Wrenched reveals how Edward Abbey’s anarchistic spirit and riotous novels influenced and helped guide the nascent environmental movement of the 1970s and ‘80s. Through interviews, archival footage and re-enactments, ML Lincoln captures the outrage of Abbey’s friends who were the original eco-warriors. Abbey’s message has lived on. Young activists are carrying on the “monkey-wrenching” torch, using his books as a source of inspiration. Wrenched captures a new generation as personified in Tim DeChristopher, who singlehandedly stopped the sale of 100,000+ of acres of public trust lands in southeastern Utah. </p>
