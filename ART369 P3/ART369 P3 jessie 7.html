					<p class = "subtitle"> Jessie H. Shoemaker  <br> <span class = "lowercase">  Director of Development </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> Jessie H. Shoemaker studies electricity markets, energy policy, and technological change at the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. If she can find time for schoolwork while fundraising for EFFY, she might graduate this spring. Jessie enjoys long walks on the beach during which batteries are discussed at length, hanging out with friends while discounting hypothetical future cash flows from aggregated residential demand response, and spending time outside, where she can fantasize about converting solar radiation into direct current with extreme efficiency. She can be found on LinkedIn and Twitter. </p>
