					<p class = "main-text"> Masaaki Miyazawa, one of the most prestigeous photographers in Japan, has been taking photos of shrines and temples for more than 10 years and has found the Japanese identity through this experience. He encountered Shikinen Sengu at Ise Jingu, the most sacred ceremony that is held once every 20 years for over a thousand years. Its sustainable design, one seemingly “sketched by nature” and meant to represent eternal youth, renews its visitors with the sense that humankind can indeed live within nature rather apart from it. This beautiful and meditative film illustrates this ancient worldview in an eloquent and reverent language we’ve long divorced from our vernacular. Forestry management, fisheries protection, watershed science, ecosystem science, green design, religion & ecology, and even the nexus between health and the environment are all explored in this expansive film. </p>

					<p class = "main-text"> Brilliant Darkness: Hotaru in the Night,  a film by Executive Producer James Karl Fischer, explores the importance of darkness, and the erosion of it, told through through the study, preservation and celebration of firefly habitats in Japan and the United States. Fireflies are reportedly disappearing, as artificial night lights disrupt their ‘language of light’. Brilliant Darkness: Hotaru in the Night, presented by the Zoological Lighting Institute and James Karl Fischer, features artists and scientists on different continents working to understand firefly flash patterns and how to live among wildlife in urban settings. </p>
