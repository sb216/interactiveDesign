			<p> We are a group of graduate students who are committed to advancing environmental awareness through the power of film. Each year, EFFY supplants its graduating leadership with promising descendants who perpetually renew the festival with fresh ideas and insights. We strive to empower the expanding community of environmental filmmakers by showcasing their work and facilitating their development. If EFFY sparks meaningful conversations while motivating others to act on newfound convictions, then our festival has succeeded. We look forward to seeing you at EFFY! </p>

			<!-- <p> Don is a Master of Environmental Management candidate at the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies. He’s a guy from Philly who spent most of his childhood beating drums, tickling piano keys, and playing outside with his sister. His insatiable curiosity eventually whisked him away to South Africa where he studied climate change on a Fulbright Fellowship. He’s created educational materials for National Geographic and lobbied for clean energy legislation at the Pew Charitable Trusts, but these days Don isn’t just focused on legalese. He’s searching for ways to describe how pissed off Mother Nature really is, and films tell her story pretty well. </p> -->
