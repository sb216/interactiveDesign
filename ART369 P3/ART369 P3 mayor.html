					<p class = "main-text"> Change is afoot in Datong. Controversial Communist Party Mayor Geng Yanbo is pulling down one of the world’s dirtiest cities to recreate its glorious past. Some 1,600 years ago, Datong was China’s capital, but it has since been subject to rampant mining that has choked the city in soot, depleted its resources and stagnated the economy. Geng wishes to remake Datong in the image of other great cultural cities, and he’s ready to displace 40,000 households to do it. But in a system where officials often do best by doing nothing, why is Geng carrying out such a controversial plan in the spotlight? Some call him the devil mayor, but Geng is too bent on his utopian vision to care. “Some say I’ve forgotten to be a politician and focused too much on practical deeds. But I’d rather endure criticism today than become a mediocre official. In a rare and intimate encounter, The Chinese Mayor looks through the eyes of those in China’s greatest era of change, to reflect a giant country with such dilemma and complications that are beyond simple black-and-white images on the news streams. </p>

					<p class = "main-text"> An open-pit mining boom is underway in northern British Columbia, Canada. The massive size and location of the mines–at the headwaters of major salmon rivers that flow across the border into Alaska–has Alaskans concerned over pollution risks posed to their multi-billion dollar fishing and tourism industries, aboriginal cultures, and traditional ways of life. These concerns were heightened with the Aug 4, 2014 catastrophic tailings dam failure at nearby Mt. Polley Mine in B.C.’s Fraser River watershed. </p>
