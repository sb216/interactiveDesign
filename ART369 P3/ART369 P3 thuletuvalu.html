					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> <span class = "lowercase"> Switzerland, 96 minutes </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> Two places at the edge of our planet are making headlines due to climate change: Thule, Greenland, is suffering from record ice melts and Tuvalu, a remote Pacific island nation that’s one of the first countries sinking beneath the waves of rising seas. Here on the front lines of climate change, ThuleTuvalu portrays how these inhabitants are forced to abandon their traditional way of life as they move toward a more uncertain future. </p>

					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> The Ballad of Holland House  <br> <span class = "lowercase"> Directed by Lynn Tomlinson </span> </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> USA, <span class = "lowercase"> 4 minutes </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> The Ballad of Holland Island House tells the true story of the last house on a sinking island in the Chesapeake Bay, brought to life through fluidly transforming animated clay-on-glass paintings. The house sings of its life and the creatures it has sheltered, and contemplates time and environmental change. Told from the house’s point of view, this film is a soulful and haunting view of the impact of sea-level rise. </p>
