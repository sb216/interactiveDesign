					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> Monsoon, <span class = "lowercase"> directed Sturla Gunnarsson </span> </p>
					<p class = "subtitle film-info"> Canada & France, <span class = "lowercase"> 109 minutes </span> </p>


					<p class = "main-text"> Part road movie, part spectacle, part human drama, Monsoon is a documentary exploration of chaos, creation and faith in the land of believers. The subject is monsoon, the incomparably vast seasonal weather system that permeates and unifies the immense and varied culture of India, shaping the conditions of existence for its billion-plus inhabitants. Filmed across the Indian sub-continent and charting the huge systemâ€Ÿs path as it surges toward and gradually engulfs every region of the country, Monsoon introduces us to a remarkable array of individuals whose lives are in different ways entwined with the phenomenon. A cinematic journey into the terrain where nature, science, belief and wonder converge in one of the most astonishing and breathtaking landscapes on earth, Monsoon is a film that captures the timelessness and rich human drama of our engagement with the natural world. </p>
