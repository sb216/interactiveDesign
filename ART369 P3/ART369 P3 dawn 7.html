					<p class = "main-text"> Dawn is a second-year Master of Environmental Science student at Yale F&ES focused on urban watershed planning. Born and raised in coastal Connecticut, her love of water resources has been shaped by her experiences swimming and fishing in the Long Island Sound. She is passionate about engaging youth and community members in local planning and restoration efforts. Prior to starting at Yale, Dawn directed a high school level apprentice program that used environmental restoration and monitoring projects on the Bronx River as tools to empower young people. She is excited to bring the spirit and power of EFFY to the youth of New Haven! </p>
